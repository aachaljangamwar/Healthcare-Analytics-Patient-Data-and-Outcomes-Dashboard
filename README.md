# Healthcare-Analytics-Patient-Data-and-Outcomes-Dashboard

In the "Healthcare Analytics: Patient Data and Outcomes" dashboard, we analyze patient information such as age, gender, blood type, medical condition, admission and discharge dates, and the associated billing details. 
The dataset includes various medical conditions treated across different hospitals, alongside details of the attending doctors, medications administered, and insurance providers. 
This comprehensive view allows us to identify patterns in healthcare services, such as the correlation between medical conditions and treatment outcomes, financial impacts, and patient demographics.
The dashboard helps in monitoring patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare processes.
